# Advanced LINQ API Showcase

## **Project Overview**

This project is a robust **Customer and Order Management System** that allows users to manage customer information and orders with authentication and authorization. It includes features for adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting customers and orders. Additionally, it has a role-based authorization system using JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure API access.

### **Key Features:**
- Customer management (CRUD operations)
- Order management (CRUD operations)
- Secure authentication with JWT
- Role-based authorization
- Error handling with custom middleware
- Caching for performance optimization
- Swagger for API documentation and testing

## **Technologies Used**

- **ASP.NET Core 5**: The core framework used for building the web API.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for interacting with the SQL database.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure authentication and authorization.
- **SQL Server**: Database for storing customer and order data.
- **Swagger**: For API documentation and testing.
- **Automapper**: For object-to-object mapping between different models.
- **Logging**: Built-in logging to track application events and errors.
- **Custom Middleware**: For handling global errors in the application.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Visual Studio 2019 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [.NET Core SDK 5.0 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [SQL Server or SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

### **Clone the Repository**

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo-name.git
cd project-repo-name
Configure Database
Open appsettings.json and configure the connection string for SQL Server:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server-name;Database=CustomerOrderDb;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  }
}
Run migrations to create the database schema:
bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet ef database update
Running the Application
Build and run the project:
bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet build
dotnet run
The application should now be running on https://localhost:5001. You can access the API endpoints from there.
Swagger UI
To interact with the API, you can use Swagger UI. Navigate to https://localhost:5001/swagger to test your endpoints.

Usage
Authentication
To interact with any API endpoint that requires authentication, follow these steps:

Login using the POST /api/auth/login endpoint to obtain a JWT token.
Copy the accessToken you receive from the response.
Use the Authorize button in Swagger to enter the token.
After authentication, you can call other endpoints such as GET /api/customers or POST /api/orders using your token.
API Endpoints
GET /api/customers – Retrieve all customers

POST /api/customers – Create a new customer

GET /api/customers/{id} – Retrieve a specific customer by ID

PUT /api/customers/{id} – Update customer details

DELETE /api/customers/{id} – Delete a customer

GET /api/orders – Retrieve all orders

POST /api/orders – Create a new order

GET /api/orders/{id} – Retrieve a specific order by ID

PUT /api/orders/{id} – Update order details

DELETE /api/orders/{id} – Delete an order
